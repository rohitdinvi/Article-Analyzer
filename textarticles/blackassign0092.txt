in fact, the initiative’s fuzzy content is being further enriched with the “health silk road” add-on narrative and “mask diplomacy” in a major soft-power push. long term: a changed bri will emerge the bri is bound to change. strategies will change. it might even be defined properly seven years after this ambitious initiative was announced it remains a blurred vision in need of a comprehensive conceptual framework, international standards, and a coherent implementation strategy. this is one of the reasons why the bri has become controversial and has caused a backlash in many countries. a shift away from roads and bridges bri expenditure up to 2019 stood at $545 billion. (wb estimate) about two-thirds of spending on bri projects has gone into the energy sector and transport however, developing countries in need of infrastructure will be terribly cash-strapped, there may be a shift away from roads, bridges, and coalfired power plants funded through chinese loans. new bri projects will probably be more strategically chosen.  beijing has been investing in the creation of a globe-spanning network of economic corridors, logistics zones, and financial centers, with stress laid on seaports and adjacent areas. egypt’s suez canal economic zone and sri lanka’s colombo port city clearly show this trend. in addition, projects are likely to focus on more sophisticated forms of connectivity, such as 5g networks or, in the wake of the pandemic, disaster management, public health-related high-tech, and even remote surgery. china will surely use the bri for the projection of its soft power, an increasingly important battlefield in international relations. the world has become aware of the risks of overwhelming reliance on china. amid of coronavirus outbreak we can see the major economies are strengthening their authorities with their major concern the usa is conducting space miningchina’s maritime aggressionindia usa $155 million defense deal, us approves sale of anti-ship missiles and torpedoes to india. blackcoffer insights 17: v.jagan, iim kashipur  previous articleestimating the impact of covid-19 on the world of worknext articletravel and tourism outlook ajay bidyarthy
